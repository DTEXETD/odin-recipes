    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These soft hamburger buns are perfect for burgers, pulled pork, or your favorite sandwich filling. </p>
    <p>'ve gotten a thousand requests for these! Not only are these the perfect shape, but they taste way better than anything that comes out of a plastic bag.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs, divided</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place yeast into bowl of a large stand mixer; whisk in 1/2 cup flour and warm water until smooth. Let stand until mixture is foamy, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Whisk 1 egg, melted butter, sugar, and salt thoroughly into the yeast mixture. Add remaining flour (about 3 cups).</li>
      <li>Fit a dough hook onto stand mixer and knead the dough on low speed until soft and sticky, 5 to 6 minutes. Scrape sides if needed. Poke and prod the dough with a silicone spatula; if large amounts of dough stick to the spatula, add a little more flour. </li>
      <li>Transfer dough onto a floured work surface; dough will be sticky and elastic but should not stick to your fingers. Gently form dough into a smooth, round shape, tucking loose ends underneath.</li>
    </ol>
