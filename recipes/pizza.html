    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza on the grill is a fantastic way to make pizza at home! The heat of a hot grill is a perfect match for a professional pizza oven.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
